## üìö Overview  
This repository is a hub for research and experimentation with generative networks used in signal generation and processing. These models leverage different techniques, like autoregressive and flow-based, to generate high-fidelity signals.

---

## ‚ú® Features  
- Implementations of popular wave networks: **WaveNet**, **WaveFlow**, and **WaveGlow**.  
- Easy-to-use scripts for training, inference, and evaluation.  
- Pre-configured Docker environment for seamless setup.  
- Dependencies managed with `requirements.txt`.
